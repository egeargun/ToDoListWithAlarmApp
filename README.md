# ToDoListWithAlarmApp
My main goal with this app was to solve a common problem: forgetting daily tasks. I wanted to create a simple tool where I can write down what I need to do, pick a specific time for it, and get a loud reminder when the time comes. I wanted to make sure the data stays safe even if I close the app.
